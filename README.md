<h2>Project Topic:- Dockerizing a simple web application, deploy it to a Kubernetes cluster using Argo CD, and manage its release process with Argo Rollouts.<h2>  

Step 1:- Creating a Git repository that hosts our code
 - includes an index.js file for web application
 - includes a kubeconfig file (./kube/config.yaml) for managing cluster
 - includes a Dockerfile for container image

Step 2:- Installing Argo CD on our Kubernetes Cluster
 - Enter "minikube start" command to start the kubernetes cluster 
 - Enter "kubectl create namespace argocd" to add a namespace "argocd"
 - Enter "kubectl apply -n argocd -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-cd/stable/manifests/install.yaml" to install Argo CD 

Step 3:- Installing Argo Rollouts controller on our Kubernetes Cluster
 - Enter "kubectl create namespace argo-rollouts" to add a namespace "argo-rollouts"
 - Enter "kubectl apply -n argo-rollouts -f https://github.com/argoproj/argo-rollouts/releases/latest/download/install.yaml" to install Argo Rollouts

Step 4:- Dockerizing the Application
 - Creating a .dockerfile to isolate the source code
 - Enter "docker build -t {username}/{reponame}:{tag}" to build a docker image
 - Enter "docker push {username}/{reponame}:{tag}" to push the docker image to docker hub[public container registry]

Step 5:- Deploying the application
 - Modifying kubeconfig file (./kube/config.yaml) to use the docker image previously pushed 
 - Enter "kubectl get pods -n argocd" to verify the activeness of Argo CD
 - Enter "argocd login {argocd-server-url} --sso --skip-test-tls --grpc-web" to login to the ArgoCD UI
 - Link your repository containing the source code and container to Argo CD using the web GUI, to start the continous deployment

Step 6:- Defining a rollout strategy
 - Define a Rollout resource (equivalent to a Deployment) in your projectâ€™s Kubernetes manifests.
 - Specify the canary strategy in the rollout definition.
 - Set the initial canary weight (e.g., 10%), pause for a specified duration (e.g., 1 hour) to monitor behavior, gradually increase the canary weight (e.g., 20%).
 
Step 7:- Implementing the Canary Release strategy with Argo CD
 - Commit your updated Kubernetes manifests to your GitHub repository.
 - Build your project code into a Docker image and push the image to Docker Hub.
 - Modify the rollout definition to use the new image.
 - Use ArgoCD to sync your application with the updated manifests.

Step 8:- Monitoring the release and changes 
 - ArgoCD will manage the rollout process based on the canary strategy.
 - Observe the behavior of the canary version.
 - Verify that the canary behaves as expected.
